  abstract = {Galaxy clusters are unique laboratories for studying astrophysical processes and their impact on halo gas kinematics. Despite their importance, the full complexity of gas motion within and around these clusters remains poorly known. This paper is part of a series presenting the first results from the new TNG-Cluster simulation, a suite comprising 352 high-mass galaxy clusters including the full cosmological context, mergers and accretion, baryonic processes and feedback, and magnetic fields. Studying the dynamics and coherence of gas flows, we find that gas motions in galaxy cluster cores and intermediate regions are largely balanced between inflows and outflows, exhibiting a Gaussian distribution centered at zero velocity. In the outskirts, even the net velocity distribution becomes asymmetric, featuring a double peak where the second peak reflects cosmic accretion. Across all cluster regions, the resulting net flow distribution reveals complex gas dynamics. These are strongly correlated with halo properties: at a given total cluster mass, unrelaxed, late-forming halos with fewer massive black holes and lower accretion rates exhibit a more dynamic behavior. Our analysis shows no clear relationship between line-of-sight and radial gas velocities, suggesting that line-of-sight velocity alone is insufficient to distinguish between inflowing and outflowing gas. Additional properties, such as temperature, can help break this degeneracy. A velocity structure function (VSF) analysis indicates more coherent gas motion in the outskirts and more disturbed kinematics toward halo centers. In all cluster regions, the VSF shows a slope close to the theoretical models of Kolmogorov ({$\sim$}1/3), except within 50 kpc of the cluster centers, where the slope is significantly steeper. The outcome of TNG-Cluster broadly aligns with observations of the VSF of multiphase gas across different scales in galaxy clusters, ranging from {$\sim$}1 kpc to megaparsec scales.},

  abstract = {The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range 0 {$\leq$} {$z$} {$<$} 1, resulting in a dataset of {$\sim$}8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the physical properties of the gaseous intracluster medium (ICM) at the center of massive galaxy clusters with TNGCluster, a new cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation. Our sample contains 352 simulated clusters spanning a halo mass range of 1014 {$<$} M500c/M {$<$} 2 {\texttimes} 1015 at z = 0. We focused on the proposed classification of clusters into cool-core (CC) and noncool-core (NCC) populations, the z = 0 distribution of cluster central ICM properties, and the redshift evolution of the CC cluster population. We analyzed the resolved structure and radial profiles of entropy, temperature, electron number density, and pressure. To distinguish between CC and NCC clusters, we considered several criteria: central cooling time, central entropy, central density, X-ray concentration parameter, and density profile slope. According to TNG-Cluster and with no a priori cluster selection, the distributions of these properties are unimodal, whereby CCs and NCCs represent the two extremes. Across the entire TNG-Cluster sample at z = 0 and based on the central cooling time, the strong CC fraction is fSCC = 24\%, compared to fWCC = 60\% and fNCC = 16\% for weak and NCCs, respectively. However, the fraction of CCs depends strongly on both halo mass and redshift, although the magnitude and even direction of the trends vary with definition. The abundant statistics of simulated high-mass clusters in TNG-Cluster enabled us to match observational samples and make a comparison with data. The CC fractions from z = 0 to z = 2 are in broad agreement with observations, as are the radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities, globally as well as when divided as CC versus NCC halos. TNG-Cluster can therefore be used as a laboratory to study the evolution and transformations of cluster cores due to mergers, AGN feedback, and other physical processes.},

  abstract = {We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of {\textasciitilde} 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.},

  abstract = {In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) clusters into non-cool-core (NCC) ones, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M500c = 1014-15.3 M ) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z . 2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their diverse assembly and supermassive black hole (SMBH) histories. On average, clusters experience two to three transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but the ones to higher-entropy cores, i.e., in the qualitative direction from CC to NCC states, make up the overwhelming majority. The CC phases are also shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves toward NCC states as cosmic time progresses. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within {$\sim$}1 Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher- (but not lower-) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z = 0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more major and minor mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z = 0. We therefore consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.},

  abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium, often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at z = 0 and find that {$\sim$}39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration with some still attached to their SMBH, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ({$\sim$} 108 K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number {$\sim$}1.5). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.},

  abstract = {The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we examine the gas thermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on the total mass and inner ICM properties, such as their cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at z = 0. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles, and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km s-1. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes {$<$}10\% to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with highvelocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km s-1. However, detecting these outflows in observations may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They also increase both the inferred and intrinsic ICM velocity dispersion. This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy lines.},
