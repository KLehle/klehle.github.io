  abstract = {Galaxy clusters are unique laboratories for studying astrophysical processes and their impact on halo gas kinematics. Despite their importance, the full complexity of gas motion within and around these clusters remains poorly known. This paper is part of a series presenting first results from the new TNG-Cluster simulation, a suite comprising 352 high-mass galaxy clusters including the full cosmological context, mergers and accretion, baryonic processes and feedback, and magnetic fields. Studying the dynamics and coherence of gas flows, we find that gas motions in galaxy cluster cores and intermediate regions are largely balanced between inflows and outflows, exhibiting a Gaussian distribution centered at zero velocity. In the outskirts, even the net velocity distribution becomes asymmetric, featuring a double peak where the second peak reflects cosmic accretion. Across all cluster regions, the resulting net flow distribution reveals complex gas dynamics. These are strongly correlated with halo properties: at a given total cluster mass, unrelaxed, late-forming halos with less massive black holes and lower accretion rates exhibit a more dynamic behavior. Our analysis shows no clear relationship between line-of-sight and radial gas velocities, suggesting that line-of-sight velocity alone is insufficient to distinguish between inflowing and outflowing gas. Additional properties, such as temperature, can help break this degeneracy. A velocity structure function (VSF) analysis indicates more coherent gas motion in the outskirts and more disturbed kinematics towards halo centers. In all cluster regions, the VSF shows a slope close to the theoretical models of Kolmogorov ({$\sim$} 1/3), except within 50 kpc of the cluster centers, where the slope is significantly steeper. The outcome of TNG-Cluster broadly aligns with observations of the VSF of multiphase gas across different scales in galaxy clusters, ranging from {$\sim$} 1 kpc to Megaparsec scales.},

  abstract = {We analyze the physical properties of the gaseous intracluster medium (ICM) at the center of massive galaxy clusters with TNGCluster, a new cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation. Our sample contains 352 simulated clusters spanning a halo mass range of 1014 {$<$} M500c/{$\mathsl{M}\odot$} {$<$} 2 {\texttimes} 1015 at {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0. We focus on the proposed classification of clusters into cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) populations, the {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0 distribution of cluster central ICM properties, and the redshift evolution of the CC cluster population. We analyze resolved structure and radial profiles of entropy, temperature, electron number density, and pressure. To distinguish between CC and NCC clusters, we consider several criteria: central cooling time, central entropy, central density, X-ray concentration parameter, and density profile slope. According to TNG-Cluster and with no a-priori cluster selection, the distributions of these properties are unimodal, whereby CCs and NCCs represent the two extremes. Across the entire TNG-Cluster sample at {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0 and based on central cooling time, the strong CC fraction is {$\mathsl{f}$}SCC = 24\%, compared to {$\mathsl{f}$}WCC = 60\% and {$\mathsl{f}$}NCC = 16\% for weak and non-cool-cores, respectively. However, the fraction of CCs depends strongly on both halo mass and redshift, although the magnitude and even direction of the trends vary with definition. The abundant statistics of simulated high-mass clusters in TNG-Cluster enables us to match observational samples and make a comparison with data. The CC fractions from {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0 to {$\mathsl{z}$} = 2 are in broad agreement with observations, as are radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities, globally as well as split for CC versus NCC halos. TNG-Cluster can therefore be used as a laboratory to study the evolution and transformations of cluster cores due to mergers, AGN feedback, and other physical processes.},

  abstract = {We introduce the new TNG-Cluster project, an addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. Our objective is to significantly increase the statistical sampling of the most massive and rare objects in the Universe: galaxy clusters with log ({$\mathsl{M}$}200c/M{$\odot$}) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 14.3 - 15.4 at {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0. To do so, we re-simulate 352 cluster regions drawn from a 1 Gpc volume, thirty-six times larger than TNG300, keeping entirely fixed the IllustrisTNG physical model as well as the numerical resolution. This new sample of hundreds of massive galaxy clusters enables studies of the assembly of high-mass ellipticals and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), satellite galaxy evolution and environmental processes, jellyfish galaxies, intracluster medium (ICM) properties, cooling and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback, mergers and relaxedness, magnetic field amplification, chemical enrichment, and the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end, with observables from the optical to radio synchrotron and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, to X-ray emission, as well as their cosmological applications. We present an overview of the simulation, the cluster sample, selected comparisons to data, and a first look at the diversity and physical properties of our simulated clusters and their hot ICM.},

  abstract = {The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study we examine the gas thermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on total mass and inner ICM properties, i.e. cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at {$\mathsl{z}$} = 0. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes {$<$} 10\% to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with high-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these outflows observationally may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They also increase both the inferred, and intrinsic, ICM velocity dispersion. This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy lines.},
