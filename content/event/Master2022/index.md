event: Presentation of Master Thesis
event_url: ''

location: Institute for Theoretical Physics

  street: ''
  city: Heidelberg
  region: ''
  postcode: ''
  country: Germany

summary: ''
abstract: 'In this talk I present the results of my Masters Thesis. I summarize the idea of including baryons in KFT and the basics of RKFT. Furthermore, I will summarize the model used to include the effects of ionizing photons into RKFT to describe the Epoch of Reionization. I will present the results of this model in static and expaning spacetime and finally compute the 21cm power spectrum of this model.'
