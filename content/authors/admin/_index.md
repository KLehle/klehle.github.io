Hey, I am Katrin Lehle, a current PhD candidate at the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, Heidelberg University. Under the guidance of [Dylan Nelson](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dnelson/), I hold a position funded by the [Hector-Fellow-Academy](https://hector-fellow-academy.de/en/). Additionally, I am a fellow at the International Max Planck Research School for Astronomy and Cosmic Physics in Heidelberg.
My research focus is centered on the gaseous intracluster medium (ICM) within galaxy clusters, with a particular emphasis on the central region and the cooling properties of the cores. To gain insight into the complex physics of galaxy clusters, I analyze cosmological galaxy formation simulations.
