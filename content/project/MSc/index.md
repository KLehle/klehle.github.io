In my Master's thesis I used the novel analytical approach to cosmic structure formation - Kinetic Field Theory - to model the 21cm power spectrum of the Epoch of Reionization. With this application we aim to establish
a link between (resummed) Kinetic Field Theory (KFT) and observations as well as simulations. 

KFT is a statistical theory for classical particles. It decomposes the cosmic density field into particles and follows their Hamiltonian trajectories through phase space. This has the crucial advantage that, since trajectories in phase space do not cross, the shell-crossing problem, present in other analytical approaches, is avoided.
