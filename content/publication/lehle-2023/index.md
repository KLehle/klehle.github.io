abstract: 'We analyze the physical properties of the gaseous intracluster medium (ICM)
  at the center of massive galaxy clusters with TNGCluster, a new cosmological magnetohydrodynamical
  simulation. Our sample contains 352 simulated clusters spanning a halo mass range
  of 1e14 < M500c/Msun < 2 x 1e15 at z = 0. We focus on the proposed classification
  of clusters into cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) populations, the z = 0
  distribution of cluster central ICM properties, and the redshift evolution of the
  CC cluster population. We analyze resolved structure and radial profiles of entropy,
  temperature, electron number density, and pressure. To distinguish between CC and
  NCC clusters, we consider several criteria: central cooling time, central entropy,
  central density, X-ray concentration parameter, and density profile slope. According
  to TNG-Cluster and with no a-priori cluster selection, the distributions of these
  properties are unimodal, whereby CCs and NCCs represent the two extremes. Across
  the entire TNG-Cluster sample at z = 0 and based on central cooling time, the
  strong CC fraction is fSCC = 24%, compared to fWCC = 60% and fNCC = 16% for
  weak and non-cool-cores, respectively. However, the fraction of CCs depends strongly
  on both halo mass and redshift, although the magnitude and even direction of the
  trends vary with definition. The abundant statistics of simulated high-mass clusters
  in TNG-Cluster enables us to match observational samples and make a comparison with
  data. The CC fractions from z = 0 to z = 2 are in broad agreement with observations,
  as are radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities, globally as well as split
  for CC versus NCC halos. TNG-Cluster can therefore be used as a laboratory to study
  the evolution and transformations of cluster cores due to mergers, AGN feedback,
  and other physical processes.'
