abstract: 'We introduce the new TNG-Cluster project, an addition to the IllustrisTNG
  suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. Our
  objective is to significantly increase the statistical sampling of the most massive
  and rare objects in the Universe: galaxy clusters with log ($푀$200c/M$ødot$) $≳$
  14.3 - 15.4 at $푧$ = 0. To do so, we re-simulate 352 cluster regions drawn from
  a 1 Gpc volume, thirty-six times larger than TNG300, keeping entirely fixed the
  IllustrisTNG physical model as well as the numerical resolution. This new sample
  of hundreds of massive galaxy clusters enables studies of the assembly of high-mass
  ellipticals and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brightest cluster galaxies
  (BCGs), satellite galaxy evolution and environmental processes, jellyfish galaxies,
  intracluster medium (ICM) properties, cooling and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback,
  mergers and relaxedness, magnetic field amplification, chemical enrichment, and
  the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end, with observables from the optical
  to radio synchrotron and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, to X-ray emission, as
  well as their cosmological applications. We present an overview of the simulation,
  the cluster sample, selected comparisons to data, and a first look at the diversity
  and physical properties of our simulated clusters and their hot ICM.'
