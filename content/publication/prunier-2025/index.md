abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
  at the centres of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation
  and shaping the intracluster medium, often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities
  embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise
  naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic
  cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy
  clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and
  magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray
  observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at z = 0 and find
  that $∼$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration
  with some still attached to their SMBH, while others have buoyantly risen. Their
  size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense
  compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($∼$ 108 K); 25 per cent
  of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak
  shock (Mach number $∼$1.5). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially
  strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at
  low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic,
  wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence
  and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic
  cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking
  bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.
