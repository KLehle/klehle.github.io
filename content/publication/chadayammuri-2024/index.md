abstract: The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures
  of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with
  other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae
  and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized
  in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state,
  luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and number of merging components. In
  this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning
  series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in
  maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning
  (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such
  images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological
  magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of
  each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range 0 $łeq$ $z$ $<$ 1, resulting
  in a dataset of $∼$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space
  forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked
  to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift,
  with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and
  with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation
  can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify
  correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships.
  Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing
  galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their
  physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy
  simulations.
