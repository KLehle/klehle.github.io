abstract: 'We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters
  from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus
  on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters.
  We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and
  plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to
  low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes
  in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss
  the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential
  magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential
  field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population,
  magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual
  halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential
  features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically
  appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and
  possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue
  that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot
  explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead,
  we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially
  biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due
  to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.'
