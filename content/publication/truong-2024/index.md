abstract: 'The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of
  the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central
  supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we examine the gas thermodynamics,
  kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy
  clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of
  simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on the total mass and inner ICM properties,
  such as their cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352
  TNG-Cluster halos at z = 0. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies
  with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles, and shock fronts that are qualitatively
  similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate
  XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data.
  In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas
  turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight
  velocity dispersion of 200 km s-1. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes
  $<$10% to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values
  of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with highvelocity outflows and bulk motions of
  relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km s-1.
  However, detecting these outflows in observations may prove challenging due to their
  anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows
  are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster
  cores. They also increase both the inferred and intrinsic ICM velocity dispersion.
  This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy
  lines.'
