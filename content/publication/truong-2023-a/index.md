abstract: 'The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of
  the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central
  supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study we examine the gas thermodynamics,
  kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy
  clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of
  simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on total mass and inner ICM properties,
  i.e. cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster
  halos at $í‘§$ = 0. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with
  disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles and shock fronts that are qualitatively
  similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate
  XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data.
  In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas
  turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight
  velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes
  $<$ 10% to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values
  of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with high-velocity outflows and bulk motions
  of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s.
  However, detecting these outflows observationally may prove challenging due to their
  anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows
  are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster
  cores. They also increase both the inferred, and intrinsic, ICM velocity dispersion.
  This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy
  lines.'
