abstract: In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations
  from cool-core (CC) clusters into non-cool-core (NCC) ones, and vice versa, in a
  sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M500c = 1014-15.3 M ) from the TNG-Cluster
  magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations
  based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z . 2.5, we find that
  clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their diverse assembly and
  supermassive black hole (SMBH) histories. On average, clusters experience two to
  three transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary,
  but the ones to higher-entropy cores, i.e., in the qualitative direction from CC
  to NCC states, make up the overwhelming majority. The CC phases are also shorter
  than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy
  cores and moves toward NCC states as cosmic time progresses. We study the role that
  mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within $âˆ¼$1 Gyr prior
  to a transformation toward higher- (but not lower-) entropy cores occur statistically
  more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of
  mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular
  momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z = 0 CC status,
  at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more major and minor
  mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z = 0. We therefore consider
  the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We
  find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby
  frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce
  a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores.
  Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible,
  but not necessary.
