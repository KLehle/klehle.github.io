abstract: 'We introduce the new TNG-Cluster project, an addition to the IllustrisTNG
  suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. Our
  objective is to significantly increase the statistical sampling of the most massive
  and rare objects in the Universe: galaxy clusters with log (M200c/M ) 14.3-15.4
  at z = 0. To do so, we re-simulate 352 cluster regions drawn from a 1 Gpc volume
  that is 36 times larger than TNG300, keeping the IllustrisTNG physical model entirely
  fixed as well as the numerical resolution. This new sample of hundreds of massive
  galaxy clusters enables studies of the assembly of high-mass ellipticals and their
  supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), satellite galaxy
  evolution and environmental processes, jellyfish galaxies, intracluster medium (ICM)
  properties, cooling and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback, mergers and relaxedness,
  magnetic field amplification, chemical enrichment, and the galaxy-halo connection
  at the high-mass end, with observables from the optical to radio synchrotron and
  the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, to X-ray emission, as well as their cosmological
  applications. We present an overview of the simulation, the cluster sample, select
  comparisons to data, and a first look at the diversity and physical properties of
  our simulated clusters and their hot ICM.'
